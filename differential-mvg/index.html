<h2>Research on Multiview Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h4><a href="http://www.lems.brown.edu/~rfabbri/">Ricardo Fabbri</a>
and <a href="http://www.lems.brown.edu/kimia.html">Benjamin Kimia</a></h4>

<p>
This project proposes a paradigm shift for 3D reconstruction from multiple
perspective projections, based on differential geometry. We
have been developing a new framework to model curved structures on both space
and time, including general non-planar curves, surfaces, shading,
curvilinear camera trajectories, and nonrigid motion.
</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.lems.brown.edu/~rfabbri/sfm/">State-of-the-art camera calibration and 3D reconstruction
systems</a> are based on very sparse point features, such as SIFT, and projective
geometry,
which can only model points and lines or
simple curves such as circles and other conic sections.  These systems
suffer from many of the following limitations: sparsity, requirements of simple
scene, controlled acquisition, difficulty with non-planar objects, requirement of strong
calibration, short baselines, and lack of geometric consistency.
</p>


<p>
Given two or more views of a fixed space curve, <b>we have shown how the torsion of the
curve can be reconstructed from image measurements</b> (<a
 href="http://www.lems.brown.edu/~rfabbri/stuff/emmcvpr-rfabbri-kimia-corrected-sign.pdf">pdf</a>). Two views
are necessary and sufficient, and more than 3 views provide an
over-constrained solution.  This study has opened an entire new line of
research, where we have extended these results to most types of contours
(rigid, occluding, nonrigid), and have been modeling many other problems
involving curvilinear phenomena
in the geometry of multiple views, including camera auto-calibration from tracked
curves, and the use of surface patches and their shading under different
illumination models for multiview applications.

We are also working on a <b>practical application</b> of automatically reconstructing complex 3D
objects from a sequence of images. One of our systems is based on
image curve fragments as obtained from a subpixel edge linker. The simple case of
possible corresponding curve fragments in two views is shown in the following
figure, where the epipolar lines are in green:

</p>



<p>
A curve-based
reconstruction has many advantages over point features:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Curves are dense, and their geometric consistency allow for meaningful and
 recognizable multiview reconstructions of complex scenes, as compared to point clouds.</li>
 <li>Curves are intimately related to the geometry of the underlying surface,
 being useful in practice as a reliable constraints for surface-based reconstructions
 of general scenes.</li>
 <li>Curves as are largely invariant to illumination.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have been tackling the challenges of using linked curve fragments, namely the
instabilities in linking and correspondence and the existence of multiple curve
models (e.g. fixed, occluding, nonrigid). More publications to
come soon.

 <ul>
   <li>Theoretical paper on recovering torsion and curvature derivative of a
   space curve from multiple perspectives  </li>
   <li>The formulas in the original paper have some minor imprecisions regarding the <i>sign</i> of the
   curvature. The corrected version fixes this issue.
   <li>I wrote extensions of the formulas that take into account the
   <i>intrinsic</i> parameters. They show how the image point, tangent, curvature, and
   curvature derivative change under the transformation given by the intrinsic
   parameter matrix <tt>K</tt>.
   </li>
   <li> I implemented the formulas of this paper in a curve
   reconstruction system, just drop me an email and I will provide you with 
   the code. </li>
