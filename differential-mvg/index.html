<h2>Research on Multiview Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h4><a href="http://rfabbri.github.io">Ricardo Fabbri</a>
and <a href="http://www.lems.brown.edu/kimia.html">Benjamin Kimia</a></h4>

<p>
This project proposes a paradigm shift for 3D reconstruction from multiple
perspective projections, based on differential geometry. We
have been developing a new framework to model curved structures on both space
and time, including general non-planar curves, surfaces, shading,
curvilinear camera trajectories, and nonrigid motion.
</p>
<p> <a href="../sfm/index.html">State-of-the-art camera calibration and 3D reconstruction
systems</a> are based on very sparse point features, such as SIFT, and projective
geometry,
which can only model points and lines or
simple curves such as circles and other conic sections.  These systems
suffer from many of the following limitations: sparsity, requirements of simple
scene, controlled acquisition, difficulty with non-planar objects, requirement
of strong calibration, abundant texture, short baselines, and lack of geometric
consistency. We believe these systems are useful but form only a module within a
greater structure from motion system.
</p>

<p>
Given two or more views of a fixed space curve, in 2004 <b>we have shown how the torsion of the
curve can be reconstructed from image measurements</b> (<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08256">pdf</a>). Two views are necessary and
sufficient, and more than 3 views provide an
over-constrained solution.  This initial study has opened an entire new line of
research, where we have extended these results to most types of contours
(rigid, occluding, nonrigid), and have been modeling many other problems
involving curvilinear phenomena
in the geometry of multiple views, including camera auto-calibration from tracked
curves, the use of surface patches and their shading under different
illumination models, and fields of both short and long curve fragments for multiview applications.

<p>
We are also working on a <b>practical and comprehensive application</b> for automatically reconstructing complex 3D
objects from a sequence of images, and have completed many modules. <a href="http://multiview-3d-drawings.sf.net">One of our systems</a> is based on
image curve fragments as obtained from a subpixel edge linker. A simple step
in corresponding curve fragments in two views is shown in the following
figure, where the epipolar lines are in green:

<p>
A curve-based
reconstruction has many advantages over point features:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Curves are dense, and their geometric consistency allow for meaningful and
 recognizable multiview reconstructions of complex scenes, as compared to point clouds.</li>
 <li>Curves are intimately related to the geometry of the underlying surface,
 being useful in practice as a reliable constraints for surface-based reconstructions
 of general scenes.</li>
 <li>Curves as are strongly invariant to illumination.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We tackled the challenges of using linked curve fragments, namely the
instabilities in linking and correspondence in the 3D Drawing system. The
existence of multiple curve models (e.g. fixed, occluding, nonrigid), the trifocal bootstrapping of the system, and the surfacing of 3D Drawings are currently active topics.

   <li>The main result is the reconstruction of torsion and curvature derivative of a
   space curve from multiple perspectives, a fundamental theorem I proved in 2004 in the
   beginning of my Ph.D. This paper is the outgrowth of that effort, including
   continuous motion, non-rigid scenes, intrinsic parameters and camera estimation from occluding
   contours. It is the seed for a monograph I've been writing, a kind of an extended Hartley &amp; Zisserman's book for general curves and differential geometry. For instance, if you need to reconstruct orientations from two or more views (SIFT orientations or other vector fields, including curvature and torsion fields), this is the place to go. The notation to deal with these problems is also the most up to date in this manuscript. Code is available as part of the code for the <a href="http://multiview-3d-drawing.sf.net">3D curve drawing system</a>.
